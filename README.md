# Siren Detector - Smart Traffic Management System

Welcome to the Siren Detector project, a part of the Smart Traffic Management System! This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to detect siren sounds of emergency vehicles.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and use the Siren Detector:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras

### Installing Dependencies

Install TensorFlow and Keras using the following commands:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
```

Training Your AI Model
To train your own AI model for siren detection, run:
```bash
python trainer.py
```
This will initiate the training process using the Adam optimizer and binary cross entropy for loss calculation.

### Testing the Model
To test the trained model on sample siren sounds, run:

```bash
python lvetester.py
```

This will evaluate the performance of the model on test data.

### Using the Siren Detector
Once the model is trained and tested, you can use it to detect siren sounds in real-time. Implement the detector in your Smart Traffic Management System for efficient handling of emergency vehicles.
